# Discogra: A Music and Discography Finding Tool

Discogra is a tool using the [Discogs.com API](https://www.discogs.com/developers) and the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) to help users find music they are interested in. 

It uses the following technologies.

* [Discogs.com API](https://www.discogs.com/developers) and [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) for music and genre searching
* [Bulma CSS Library](https://bulma.io/) for styling and layout
    * [Bulma Cards Template](https://github.com/BulmaTemplates/bulma-templates/blob/master/templates/cards.html)
* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to work with time
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the GitHub icon and font styling

It has the following functionality.

* Connects to two server side APIs and renders dynamic results based on user entry
* Utilizes the open source CSS library [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma)
* Utilizes local storage to store persistent user data such as saving of users input and data including genres related to searches and previous search history
* Customized Bulma Modal to show details of results from the Discogs API
* Using fetch for AJAX calls to pull data and DOM manipulation for responsive data rendering
* Trending Singles that default to the rock genre but once the users enter searches random associated genres of music will show
* Similarly by default YouTube videos are shown in the 'you might like this...' section with a default of 'Top 40' but a genre related to searches the user makes will be shown after search results exist
* The ability to search for bands, albums and genres
* An interactive saved search history of previous searches

## Connections

Near the top of the scripts.js file there is a variables section where API keys can be updated for connection after pulling the repo. The YouTube free API limit in particular is relatively low so if it runs out you can create a new project and then new API key in Google Dev Console and then enable YouTube v3 API also.
